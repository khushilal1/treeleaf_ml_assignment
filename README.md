# **Model Evaluation and Result Saving**

## **Overview**
This project evaluates machine learning models using standard classification metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It supports both scikit-learn models (such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest) and Keras models (e.g., Neural Networks). After evaluation, the results are printed to the console and saved in CSV format for easy comparison.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and saving results in a DataFrame format.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **tensorflow / Keras**: For evaluating Keras-based neural network models.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and model predictions.
- **joblib**: For loading pre-trained scikit-learn models.
- **os**: For handling file system operations like directory creation and checking.
